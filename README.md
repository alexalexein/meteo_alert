# Description
I check the weather forecast daily to know whether is going to rain tomorrow were I live or if its going to be sunny where I am going on weekends.
Therefore, I end up wasting a lot of time unblocking my phone, searching the wheather app, opening it and finding the info I am looking for.

The aim of this app is to enable the user to create and configure daily alerts which allow them to avoid having to open any app to check any wheather info.
